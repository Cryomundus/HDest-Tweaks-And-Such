# Ted Tweaks

A large collection of changes and 'tweaks' I've wanted to do to Hideous Destructor.

## Note: This always targets the latest unstable build of Hideous Destructor from <https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor>! It will likely not work with any other version

## If you want to use any of the LANGUAGE lump changes, you'll need to load it after any mods you want to use too
