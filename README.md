# Ted Tweaks

A large collection of various tweaks I enjoy using for 'Hideous Destructor'. Current feature set:

- Make *ERPs not require spamming reload in order to be fixed.
- Make Light Amp Goggles not have fucky FOV scaling.
- Made the Jetpack not so obscenely loud and heavy.
- Radsuit now has a unique overlay instead of just a screen tint and weighs less.
- Decreased ladder weight.
- Added the compass changes from Cozi's Hideous Helmet fork.
