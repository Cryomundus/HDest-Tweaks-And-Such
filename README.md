# Ted Tweaks

A large collection of various tweaks I enjoy using for 'Hideous Destructor'. Current feature set:

- Make *ERPs not require spamming reload in order to be fixed.
- Make Light Amp Goggles not have fucky FOV scaling.
- Made the Jetpack not so obscenely loud and heavy.
- Radsuit now has a unique overlay instead of just a screen tint and weighs less.
- Decreased ladder weight.
- Added the compass changes from Cozi's Hideous Helmet fork.
- Improved Player Climbing.
- Removed Zerk constant wounding and messages.
- Cacodemon Corpse volume decreased.
- Modern Green lite amp type made more... green.
- Blursphere no longer hides lite amp overlay.
- Blursphere now uses blurspheretexts lump.
- Air Supply is now 90 seconds.
- Operators now have more names and lines.
- Invulnerability Sphere now has a CVAR associated with it of **hd_nonecroghost** and it defaults to 'false'.
- Keeper integration, patched for new wounds also and re-added keeping Blues on death.
- Light corruption cards support.
- Friendly marines have more name potential and voice line potential.
- Light Amplification Goggles no longer flicker.
- IEDs no longer explode on dormant enemies.
