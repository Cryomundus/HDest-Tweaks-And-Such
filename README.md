# Ted Tweaks

A large collection of various tweaks I enjoy using for 'Hideous Destructor'. Current feature set:

- Make *ERPs not require spamming reload in order to be fixed.
- Make Light Amp Goggles not have fucky FOV scaling.
- Made the Jetpack not so obscenely loud.
- Radsuit no longer has an ugly green overlay
