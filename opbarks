What's our kill count?
I want {coffee|wine|pizza|to kill something|pictures of spiderman|dragon plushes|to change my OS again|an empire ears odin|a Warwick Acoustics bravura}.
If I had a {Boris Field Glyph|Rocket Launcher|blursphere|say in where we were deploying|few more grenades|better team|couple more people just as good as $YOU\c[Green]} we'd have won by now.
Where can I find a fourth for {bridge|caravan}?
I like {shorts|jorts|pants|hoodies|boots|IEMs|on-ear headphones|serpentipedes}! They're comfy and easy to wear!
I used to quote Monty Python a lot but then I took a bullet to the {knee|scrotum|serpentipede|Boss}.
Hey, everybody! $YOU\c[Green] is looking at GAY PORNO!
So then I says to {Mabel|Frances|Gertrude|$YOU\c[Green]}...

But I'm stuff!
God I love the {Mk. IV 'Boss'|Volt ZM66 Assault Rifle|Mouletta 99FX|Boris Field Glyph|SPOS-E28|Mod-3 Daszynski Carbine}. How about you $YOU\c[Green]?
God the fuckin' {ZM7 'Liberator'|Mk. III 'Vulcanette'|Mk. VII Ultralight Cannon} sucks {ass|dick|scrotum|nips}, hate that {heavy|bulky|complicated|cumbersome} sack of {shit|piss}.

Man these mutants are looking a lot different here...
I found an artefact! I think? It looks weird...
Hopefully we don't run into any Freedom.
I wonder where all of the Ecologists are, used to see them everywhere.
Glad I haven't seen any bloodsuckers lately...
People keep calling me 'marine', do they think I'm a duty member? I'm not sure anymore.
This place feels weird...
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Home sweet home.
Man, I should get an Abigal CX31993 dongle for my Sennheiser HD-560s...
Loving this KSC-75x I found near that imp! He had good taste.
Wish this was a real meteorite... This IEM's pretty nice though.
